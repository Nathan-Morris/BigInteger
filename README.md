# BigInteger

* Turns out it's too slow, reworking it without the bulky bitwise arithmetic operations *

It's very slow, not optimized, pieced together, none the less it seems like it works. It's supposed to be a port of sorts from the Java 'BigInteger' class. Hopefully to be used in conjunction with a small RSA project I'm working on
